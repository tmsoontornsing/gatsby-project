# The Kind Farmer and the Ungrateful Cobra 🧑‍🌾 🐍

One sunny morning in a small village in Thailand, there lived a kind-hearted farmer named Somchai. He was known throughout the village for his generosity and his amazing ability to grow the sweetest mangoes in the region. 🥭

One day, while tending to his mango orchard, Somchai heard strange noises coming from behind a large rock. Curious, he peeked around it and found a cobra trapped under a fallen branch. The cobra looked at him with pleading eyes, its body struggling to break free. 😢

"Please help me, kind farmer," the cobra hissed softly. "I promise I won't bite you. I just want to return to my family." 🐍👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Somchai, being the compassionate soul he was, carefully lifted the branch and freed the cobra. Instead of slithering away, the cobra raised its hood and prepared to strike! 😱

"Why would you bite me after I helped you?" Somchai asked, jumping back in surprise.

The cobra laughed, "Because that's what cobras do! We bite, it's in our nature!" 😈

But Somchai was cleverer than the cobra thought. "Oh, wise cobra," he said calmly, "before you bite me, let's ask three other animals if this is the right thing to do. If they agree with you, I'll accept my fate." 🧠

The cobra, amused by this suggestion, agreed. They first met a water buffalo working in the rice field. 🐃

"Of course the cobra should bite!" said the buffalo. "Humans have made me work hard all my life!" 😤

Next, they found an old tiger resting in the shade. 🐅
"Humans have destroyed my home," growled the tiger. "Bite him!"

Somchai's heart sank, but he didn't give up. Finally, they came across a small monkey eating bananas in a tree. 🐒

The clever monkey scratched its head and said, "I don't understand. How exactly was the cobra trapped? Could you show me?" 🤔

The cobra, eager to prove its point, slid under the branch again. Quick as lightning, Somchai dropped the branch back on the cobra! 💫

"Now who's going to bite whom?" Somchai grinned. 😏

The cobra begged for mercy once again, promising to really be good this time. But Somchai just shook his head and said, "Some lessons need to be learned twice!" He left the cobra trapped there until sunset, only then setting it free. 🌅

From that day on, the cobra never tried to bite anyone who helped it, and Somchai's mango orchard became a peaceful place where even snakes learned about gratitude. 🥭✨

The village elders still tell this tale to children, reminding them that kindness is good, but wisdom is just as important as being kind. And sometimes, the cleverness of a simple farmer can outsmart the deadliest of creatures! 👴📖

*Moral: Be kind, but also be wise. Not everyone who asks for help has good intentions, and it's okay to be clever when dealing with tricksters!* 🧠💫
